# Duo-to-log
Based on a blend of https://github.com/libresec/duo-log-grabber and https://github.com/duosecurity/duo_client_python/blob/master/examples/splunk/splunk.py. 

The overall goal is to have Telegraf use the script and sent it to the logger of your choice. In our setup, we will use Graylog.

# TODO
Alot of cleaning up the script, this is just a working sample.
